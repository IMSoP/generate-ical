I.m going to explore a couple of infrastructure ideas to carry out what I call .high-performance, low-latency. logging to ensure minimal impact to the performance of the runtime application. The talk will show you that a really great logging architecture is a low-cost investment in your application that will definitely pay off in the long run.
